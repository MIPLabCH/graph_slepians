description: The study of complex systems benefits from graph models and their analysis.
  In particular, the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian lets emerge properties
  of global organization from local interactions; e.g., the Fiedler vector has the
  smallest non-zero eigenvalue and plays a key role for graph clustering. Graph signal
  processing focusses on the analysis of signals that are attributed to the graph
  nodes. The eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian allows to define the graph
  Fourier transform and extend conventional signal-processing operations to graphs.
  Here, we introduce the design of Slepian graph signals, by maximizing energy concentration
  in a predefined subgraph for a graph spectral bandlimit. We establish a novel link
  with classical Laplacian embedding and graph clustering, which provides a meaning
  to localized graph frequencies.
